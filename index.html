    <h1>Meteorite Landings on Earth</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our celestial journey into the fascinating world of meteorites! These enigmatic space rocks, remnants of distant cosmic events, have captured the imagination of scientists and stargazers alike for centuries. Meteorites provide us with invaluable clues about the universe's origin and evolution, shedding light on our place in the cosmos.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>One of the key aspects that make each meteorite unique is its "recclass" or classification. This classification system categorizes meteorites based on their mineral composition, providing insights into their origins and the cosmic processes they've endured. Join us as we delve deeper into the extraordinary world of meteorites and unravel the stories they hold from the far reaches of space.</p>


    <h2>Globe Visualization of Meteorites by Recclass</h2>
    <p>Our interactive globe offers a captivating insight into meteorite landings around the world, where each meteorite's "recclass" is distinguished by a unique and vivid color. As you explore this immersive experience, you'll witness the cosmic journey of these space rocks, beautifully mapped onto the Earth's surface.</p>

    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
